<p>We are scholars at SMASH Wharton. SMASH (Summer Math and Science Honors Academy) is a 5-week summer program in which we live on the University of Philadelphia college campus and go to classes from monday - friday. We have workshops often that teach us many valuable lessons such as communicating with the others and taking care of ourselves.</p>
<p>After spending five weeks on campus with with other selected scholars, we have done a project in which we work with groups to do research and learn as much as possible about our chosen infectious disease.</p>
<p>Weâ€™re working with Pertussis and we have done many interviews and research on the disease. We have to use all the information we have received from all of our classes including Math, Biology, Computer Science, Design Thinking and Marketing to have a successful project. We are doing a project to get a better understanding of how we can work within our community to address a significant public issue such as an infectious disease or chronic disease. More specifically, we are trying to figure out how might we spread awareness to school children in Philadelphia of the symptoms of Pertussis and the precautions that should be taken.</p>
