    <p>Pertussis is a highly contagious bacterial disease that is very common in infants and children. It’s spread from from person to person through contact with fluids from an infected person’s mouth or nose. When infected, bacteria called Bordetella Pertussis attach to and line the upper respiratory system. Symptoms include a severe cough and fever. It’s also common to vomit due to coughing fits.The way to stop the spread of Pertussis is to raise awareness within the susceptible community. We decided to do this through a mobile game for kids to educate them in a way that’s entertaining. A game will let kids interact while learning about what to avoid and be cautious of when it comes to Pertussis.In the game, there will be bonus levels where there will be a hypothetical situation explained and the player has to choose what they want to do.</p>
