<p>Our solution is basically a game for kids to raise awerness to the kids in a fun way. People don't like others talking but what about a game that can be fun and teaches kids how to prevemt this infectious disease.
    This disease can be stopped by getting the vaccine. However people sometimes aren't familiar with this and can get infected. Especially infants and toddlers, they are most exposed to this and on some rare cases, they'll die. We design a game that kids can learn from. For example you'll have levels were you have to choose what to do. Either wash your hands,eat right a way,or Play outside.
