    <P>The way we decided to stop the spread of Pertussis is to raise awareness within the susceptible community. We decided to do this through a mobile game for kids to educate them in a way that’s entertaining. A game will let kids interact while learning about what to avoid and be cautious of when it comes to Pertussis.</p>

    <p>The game will help kids understand proper hygiene and the importance of getting the vaccine to prevent this horrible disease. It’ll be a 2D platform game where the player’s customizable character runs away from the bacteria. The goal is to avoid illness carriers in the classroom. They’ll be put in situations where they have to choose what what would be best to do. Kids will learn throughout that being clean is really important and helps them to stay away from the Whooping Cough. In addition, parents can be confident that their child knows about the disease and knows what to be cautious of. All in all, this app is fun, educational, and helpful to everyone.</p>
